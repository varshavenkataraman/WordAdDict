How to Use?
(Note: Make sure you have enabled Developer Mode on chrome://extensions/. If not enabled- toggle it on the top-right corner of the page.)

Method 1- Quick Installation using .crx file:
1. You don't really have to download all the files- just download the .crx file.
2. Drag-and-drop it on your Chrome browser's 'chrome://extensions/' page.
3. Refresh the page you're reading and see to it that the extension is enabled.
4. Double-click on any word and to close the definition card, you can click on any part of the screen. (Click on the audio icon to listen to the pronunciation.)

Method 2- Load Unpacked:
1. Download the zip file, extract the files and select the WordAdDict folder through the 'Load Unpacked' button, on the top-left part of the chrome://extensions/ page.
2. Refresh the page you're currently reading and check whether the extension is enabled.
3. Double-click on any word to see its definition or hear its pronunciation.
Troubleshooting Tip: If you find any errors on the Extensions page, just delete them and reload the extension.

Limitations:
1. It may not work on websites with strict Content Security Policies(CSP), like Google Docs.
2. Pronunciation is available only for a few words that Free Dictionary API provides.
3. While this extension would be more useful when reading PDFs on Chrome, WordAdDict doesn't work on PDFs.
4. You may not be able to get definitions of highly specific jargons.
